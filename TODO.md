# Security Upgrade TODO

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Core Security Infrastructure
- [x] Create comprehensive plan
- [x] Create security configuration module (`security_config.py`)
- [x] Enhanced Flask application with multi-layered security (`app.py`)
- [x] Secure loader client with encryption (`loader.py`)
- [x] Update requirements with new dependencies (`requirements.txt`)

### Phase 2: Advanced Protection Layers
- [x] Enhanced ocho.py with additional security measures
- [x] Dynamic token generation system
- [x] Request signature validation
- [x] Rate limiting and anti-replay protection

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) â†’ AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing
- [x] Install dependencies and test basic functionality
- [x] Test security layers and authentication
- [x] Validate security system is blocking unauthorized access
- [x] Test brute force protection mechanisms

### Phase 4: Final Steps
- [ ] Commit and push changes to repository
- [ ] Verify all security measures are working
- [ ] Document final security features

## Security Features Being Implemented
- Dynamic token authentication with time-based expiration
- Device fingerprinting and hardware validation
- Multi-layered encryption for API communications
- Advanced rate limiting per IP and device
- Request signature validation using HMAC
- Anti-replay attack protection with nonce validation
- Code obfuscation and dynamic serving
- Comprehensive monitoring and threat detection
